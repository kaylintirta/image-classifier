# Image Classification on Fashion MNIST Dataset
For this project, we have the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset which contains a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 pixels grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Here's an example how the data looks,

The goal of this project is to create a neural network model to classify clothing images by predicting their labels.
